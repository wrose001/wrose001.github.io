                    <p>Hello! My name is Weston Rose, and I have been working in the field of higher education administration for almost a decade after earning my master's degree in English in 2010. After a few years of teaching Composition & Rhetoric to college freshmen and working part-time as an acadmic advisor, I began working as a Media & Communications Specialist in the Office of Graduate Studies at Sam Houston State University. In addition to editing a magazine about graduate student research, one of my responsibilities was to update my office's web section as a content publisher, using a content management system called WebCMS. I became very interested in learning to code at this point because while I could create, edit, and delete webpages, I found that using the WYSIWYG mode limited my abilities; I started researching HTML and making small changes to the source code. In 2016, I moved to Austin and began working as a Program & Communications Coordinator for the Office of Academic Affairs at The University of Texas System Administration. Many of my responsibilities, including working as a content publisher, are similar to those of my previous position. I recently enrolled in the UT Austin Coding Boot Camp because I want to strengthen my skill set and increase my knowledge of how to write code, build websites and apps, and troubleshoot new and exciting challenges. One more thing: I completed a certificate in Visual Design through General Assembly in December 2019. In this program, I learned Gestalt Principles related to web design, color theory, typography, and how to layout websites and apps through Adobe XD, which could then be given to a web developer to code.</p>
